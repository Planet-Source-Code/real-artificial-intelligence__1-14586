## Real Artificial Intelligence


</div>

### Description

This demonstrates how to program artificial intelligence in vb. It is a bug (insect, not a computer data destroyer) that wonders around a grid and when it meets a wall it remembers it and marks it. Then when it has been running for a few minutes it will know alot of the walls. When you exit and reload the program later it won't mark it again because it knows its been there.
